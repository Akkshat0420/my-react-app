            The average smartphone has a lifespan of just 2-3 years, but many devices are disposed of before they reach their full potential. At Fixyantra, we tackle this issue by refurbishing old devices, reducing the need for new production, and keeping more electronics out of landfills. Our efforts contribute to decreasing e-waste and fostering environmental sustainability.
